			<h1>and Component-Based Architecture</h1>
		</div>
		<Notes>
			<p>
				Let's move on to our first topic. We'll talk about one of the main
				factors how we can build immersive user experiences quickly and
				effectively. Let's start with why would we need JavaScript frameworks in the first place. It's perfectly
				possible to code without using them â€“ however, a well-chosen framework will make your work a lot easier.
				Furthermore, they are free and open-source, so there's no risk in trying, now is there?

				First and foremost, it improves your efficiency. Think of it as a shortcut of sorts: you have to write
				less code manually, as there are functions and patterns already pre-written and ready for you to use.
				Some components of a website do not need to be custom-made, therefore, you can just pre-built ones and
				build on them. Without the need to work on basic yet time-consuming tasks, you can concentrate on
				building unique features and perfecting specific details.

				The next advantage of JavaScript frameworks comes from its huge user base. Most of the time, you have
				extensive documentation, support groups, community blogs, and forums. Users are quick to test new
				updates and report bugs, which means the issues are detected and resolved without hassle.
			</p>
			<p>
				The core concept most of these frameworks use is what we call
				component-based architecture. Instead of building these monolithic
				pages, we utilize pierce together reusable components to build our
				application. Each component encapsulates specific functionality, like
				one form or one modal can be component, even these controls can be their
				own component which we can reuse on any other page, and can be combined
				like building blocks.

		<Notes>
			At the core of this transformation is the concept of component-based
			architecture. Instead of building monolithic pages, we craft applications
			by piecing together reusable components. Each component encapsulates
			specific functionality and can be combined like building blocks to form
			intricate interfaces. This approach not only improves the efficiency of
			development but also enhances maintainability and encourages collaboration
			among teams.
			<p>
				A component is usually a UI element such as a button, pop-up, or
				navigation bar. You only need to create a component once and you can
				reuse it in any context within the application.
			</p>

				Let's explore some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks today by
				building a simple Todo app for each one.

				Now this is where it gets complicated with vanilla. In order to update
				the UI, we need to manually create a new list item element by calling
				document create element, then we need to update its inner html to the
				to-do text and finally append it to the unordered list in the DOM.

				We just built a to-do app with vanilla JS, but this is not going to
				scale very well. If we're going to add routing or animation, we need to

			The most popular framework or library today. Facebook developers started working on it to simplify their own

			React is based on reusable components. To put it simply, these are blocks of code that can be classified as
			either classes or functions. Each component represents a specific part of a page, like a logo, a button, or
			an input box. The parameters they take are called props, which stands for properties. You can call your
			components in a certain order, place one inside the other, and create the look you like.

				Angular, developed by Google, is a comprehensive framework for building

			<Step class="mt-5">

		</div>

		<Notes>
			Just like React, Angular has a component-based structure. You can manipulate, nest, and reuse them as you
			need.

			To write an application on Angular, you will need to use TypeScript. Basically, it is a superset of
			JavaScript that uses the same syntax but also supports static typing and classes. The system of types is
			incredibly versatile as well: with TypeScript, you get access modifiers, enums, generics, hybrid types, and
			much more. TypeScript has its benefits - static type checking can be very useful for large-scale
			applications, and can be a big productivity boost for developers with backgrounds in Java and C#. After
			you're done, an ahead-of-time compiler compiles your code into clean JavaScript. This way,
			you can create a more robust project which will work in any OS and any host.

			Angularâ€™s learning curve is much steeper. The API surface of the framework is huge and as a user you will
			need to familiarize yourself with a lot more concepts before getting productive. The complexity of Angular
			is largely due to its design goal of targeting only large, complex applications - but that does make the
			framework a lot more difficult for less-experienced developers to pick up.

			Svelte is a JavaScript framework that has been gaining popularity among developers in recent years. It is
			known for its simplicity, performance, and ease of use. Svelte is often compared to other popular frameworks
			such as React and Vue.js.

			In a comparison of Svelte vs. Vue, ProCoders 1 notes that Svelte is based on a tool for compiling components
			at the build stage, allowing you to load only what is needed to display your application on the page. This
			means there is no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework at runtime. This is the
			main difference between Svelte and Vue, and the main argument in the Svelte vs. React vs. Angular vs. Vue
			battle.

			Kinsta 2 notes that both Svelte and React follow component-based development architecture, but the
			difference comes in the fact that React utilizes JSX, whereas Svelte is a language in itself composed of the
			three standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, Svelte code is much more easily read and has
			no unnecessary code.

			Twilio 3 compares Svelte and React and shows how to build a basic app with both frameworks. LogRocket Blog 4
			examines the syntactical differences between Svelte and Vue, comparing how they work under the hood.
